What we need?
    List holding information from the previous iteration(iteration == the run() call before the actual call)
    List with the new information, that we have read from the file during THIS iteration
    We should check if the file is readable File.canRead()
    If we will have a new message, then we need to store it somewhere.





First Iteration(First time run() gets called, right after doing Thread.start())
